# US Accidents Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## **EDA:**  

EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is an essential step in the data analysis process that involves analyzing and summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. EDA helps in understanding the underlying patterns, relationships, and trends within the data, which can then guide further analysis and decision-making.

## **Description about the dataset:**
**A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset (2016 - 2023)**: This is a countrywide car accident dataset that covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data were collected from February 2016 to March 2023, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks. The dataset currently contains approximately 7.7 million accident records.

## **Hereâ€™s the step by step process to build this project:**
- Select a large real-world dataset from Kaggle
- Perform data preparation & cleaning using Pandas & Numpy
- Perform exploratory analysis & visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Summarize your inferences & write a conclusion

 ### *Note:* This dataset does not contain information about New York.
