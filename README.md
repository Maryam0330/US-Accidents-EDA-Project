Description about the dataset:

US Accidents (2016 - 2023)
A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset (2016 - 2023): This is a countrywide car accident dataset that covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data were collected from February 2016 to March 2023, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data.
